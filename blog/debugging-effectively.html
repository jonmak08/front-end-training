Instead of blankly staring at the code, hopefully these tips will the debugging process easier.</p><h3>Search for surrounding text</h3><p>Maybe you are looking for something around an error message (e.g. "A user with that OpenID already exists.") that is appearing in a portlet. Use <em>Sublime Text</em> to search for the error message string in Liferay's <em>source</em> code. Your search results should return several <code>Language_*.properties</code> files. These files indicate that this text is being translated from English to other languages.</p><p>The underlying property name is a <em>language key</em> that matches this value, <em>a-user-with-that-open-id-already-exists</em>. Now search for this string within Liferay's <em>source</em> code and ignore all the results in the <code>Language_*.properties</code> files. You will see, in a file called <code>open_id.jsp</code>, that this message is displayed when a <em>DuplicateOpenIdException</em> occurs.</p><p>What causes a <em>DuplicateOpenIdException</em> to be thrown?</p><p>Search for <code>throw new DuplicateOpenIdException</code> and you will find the answer in <code>UserLocalServiceImpl.java</code>.</p><p>A similar technique can be used to locate the file in which a particular view of a portlet is being generated. Just look for a rare string and search for it using <em>Sublime Text</em>.</p><p>Along the lines of the last point, if you see a call to a function and think the bug you're looking for is occurring in that function, search for the function definition.</p><p>If you are looking at a function definition and know that the file with the bug in it must be using that function, search for all calls to the function.</p><p><em>Sublime Text has a plugin <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/WhoCalled%20Function%20Finder">WhoCalled Function Finder</a> for this exact use case</em>.</p><h3>Print output</h3><p>If you are debugging a JavaScript file and want to know the value of any variable or expression at any point in the code, use <code>console.log()</code>. This will print the value of the expression to the browser's JavaScript console within the DevTools.</p><p>In a <code>.java</code> file or a Java scriptlet in a <code>.jsp</code> file, a <code>System.out.println()</code> statement will print to the <em>Terminal/Git Bash</em> in which you are running Tomcat.</p><p>Outside a Java scriptlet in a <code>.jsp</code> file, you can print directly to the browser by enclosing the Java expression in a block surrounded by <code>&lt;%=</code> and <code>%&gt;</code> tags.</p><h3>Browser's JavaScript console</h3><p>Use the browser's JavaScript console to debug and test code. If you declare a JavaScript variable as a <em>window</em> variable within the Liferay's <em>source</em> code (e.g, <code>window.numColors = 2;</code> instead of <code>var numColors = 2;</code>), you can access this variable by typing it in the browser's JavaScript console.</p><p>Just be sure to remove all declarations of <em>window</em> variables before submitting your code for review. If this variable has a function available to it, say <code>toString()</code>, you can get the function definition by typing <code>numColors.toString</code>, or you can get the result of a function call by typing <code>numColors.toString()</code>.</p><p>More generally, you can use the console to test your own snippets of JavaScript code before putting them in Liferay's <em>source</em> code.</p><p>Again, don't be afraid to ask for help when you need to.</p></article><input type="hidden" value="Debugging effectively"><input type="hidden" value="Front-End Training"></div><div
